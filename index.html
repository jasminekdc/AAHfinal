    <h1> Western Influence on Chinese Art Exhibit
 </h1>
     
    <p>
        
The exhibit I have created for today focuses on Modern Chinese art and western influences that impact it. Today I hope you will learn how heavily an artistâ€™s ideology is translated into their work and effects the art they produce as a way of communicating a bigger idea and concept.
