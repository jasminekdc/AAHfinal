    <h1> Western Influence on Chinese Art Exhibit
 </h1>
     
    <p>
        
In this painting a large group of people with varying ages and backgrounds are pictured. They are posed in front of Tiananmen Square which is a national symbol. Mao Zedong is framed in the center representing people united under him. Navy soldiers are shown on the right along with a group of minorities to the left. This painting wants to convey the image of a large family of Chinese people. The painting as a whole shows a society in harmony with so many different people interacting in an easygoing way with the image of Mao in the center. Itâ€™s implied this peace can be attributed to him. Here a strong Chinese identity is established which the future pieces in this exhibit will question.
